      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hello there! My name is Conner Gardiner. Life isn’t to be filled with regret for the moments that we don’t experience or are unable to remember. This is where capturing that moment, with the right person, tailored to the trained eye of a professional, makes all the difference. This is the *insert name* experience. I’m creating a website to showcase that experience, for both future and returning clients, all in one place. My website would serve as a landing page for my photography outlet, that can connect with potential clients, showcase my work, and allow them to get a quick snapshot and viewpoint of what I can offer them for my created niche. The functions of the site will include the ability to display my portfolio loading it statically, providing an about me and contact page, as well as room for future growth in the future.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience for this page is for individuals and families seeking to fulfill their desire to have special moments such as family events, engagements, graduation, and mission farewell moments recorded via the precise hands of my photography. </p>  <!-- change this -->
